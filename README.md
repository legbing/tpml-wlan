Throughput Prediction using Machine Learning in Extreme High Throughput Wireless Local Area Networks
TPML-WLAN, is primarily based on predicting the value of throughput in dense deployments which consist of overlapping BSSs (basic service sets). The objective of this project is to utilize and compare the performance of machine learning techniques like Random forest, Linear regression, K nearest neighbors and so on, and deep learning models like artificial neural networks (ANN) and graph neural networks (GNN), by resourcefully manipulating the features of nodes (access points, for example, routers and stations for example, laptops) in a deployment, and to thus arrive at the optimal arrangement of the nodes, providing minimum interference and maximum throughput.
