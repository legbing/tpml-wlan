Throughput Prediction using Machine Learning in Extreme High Throughput Wireless Local Area Networks

The subdirectory NN contains all the ANN/MLP models used and deployed during the duration of the internship.
The dataset used by the models in most of the cases is "fin-dataset_2.csv" which [can be accessed here](https://github.com/legbing/tpml-wlan/blob/main/fin-dataset_2.csv)
